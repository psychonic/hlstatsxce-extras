The SuperLogs series of plugins exist to enable more detailed logging for many games, all in HL Log Standard.

These plugins give the ability to track many things not natively logged by the game in log parsers such as HLstatsX:CE, Psychostats, and others.

SuperLogs: TF2 note:
For the best experience, compile against the version/build of Sourcemod that you run on your game server. For example, huntsman arrow statistics requires compiling against and running on Sourcemod 1.3, build hg2805 (pre1.3) or later.
